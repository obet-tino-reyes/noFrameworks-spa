# noFrameworks-spa

## things that make this project work
- ajax
- wordpress api 
- local storage
- es6 modules
- form submit (to submit and get an form without any backend code there are their docs-https://formsubmit.co/)

> so im still learning a lot about javascript, on this project i can say that i wanted to learn about how single page apps work, what are the benefits of an spa or when to use it also how the frameworks like vue, react or angular do a lot of  work for us.

### things that i learned that i learned through the project.
- how ajax works and when to use it.
- i  made a router for my spa.
- what are components and how to interact between them (for example the preview of the post on the homepage then when i click it open the full post).
- how to interact with an api in this case i used the wordpress api to get data from forbes mexico.


> if you wanna try to run my project on your own server just clone it and open the page(index.html) on a  server (you have to do it cus ajax does not work if you click it on the file) also i didn't use any dependency so you dont have to install anything.


>finally if you don not understand my code read try to read everymarkdown and commen, i tried to make everything understable for everyone. ğŸ˜Š
